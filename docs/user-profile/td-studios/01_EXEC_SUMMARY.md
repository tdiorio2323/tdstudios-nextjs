## Identity & Roles

- Preferred name: **Tyler**.  
- Operates under the brand **TD STUDIOS**.  
- Self-described as someone who builds and operates systems fast, focusing on design, automation, AI, and platform building.  
- Positions self as architect and operator, not the public face.

## Core Domains

- **TD Studios**: Luxury web/brand/strategy studio for websites, branding, and social media/funnel work.  
- **Creator/adult platforms**: OnlyFans-style platforms and management systems (multiple project names in history).  
- **Cannabis branding/packaging**: High-end, often candy/cereal-inspired strain and packaging design.  
- **Command hubs/dashboards**: Personal and internal command centers for operations, API keys, projects, and agents.  
- **Educational/prompt products**: Prompt books, prompt banks, handbooks, systems like the C.L.O.S.E. Method™.

## Skills & Tooling (Evidence-Based)

- History indicates advanced comfort with modern full-stack web work (Next.js/React/TS/Tailwind, Supabase, Vercel) and repo/docs structure.  
- Repeated use of AI tooling (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) as core workflow.  
- Strong design/media orientation with Adobe CC and high-fidelity visual briefs.

## Preferences & Constraints

- Strong preference for direct, execution-first communication with no greetings, recaps, or filler.  
- Wants repo-ready file trees, manuals, and step-by-step instructions where needed.  
- Behind-the-scenes posture: no personal face/voice in public TD Studios content.  
- Referrals and internal systems (e.g., private hubs, management tooling) must remain private by default.

## Goals (Observed)

- Unify and systematize multiple projects into a coherent ecosystem.  
- Ship high-end, documented platforms, dashboards, and educational products.  
- Use AI and automation to accelerate execution while maintaining control and privacy.
