# CHANGELOG.md  
[Visibility: Private]

## v1.0.1 – 2025-11-28

### Fixes

- Replaced all instances of the prohibited word with “no filler” in relevant docs.  
- Fixed code fencing in `08_RESPONSE_TEMPLATES.md` by wrapping the file in a four-backtick block and retaining inner triple-backtick templates.  
- Added code block titles for `11_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`, `12_PROFILE.json`, and `12_PROFILE.schema.json`.  
- Updated `12_PROFILE.json` to version `1.0.1` and aligned it with `12_PROFILE.schema.json` (including required fields and property constraints).  

## v1.0 – 2025-11-28

### Summary

- Initial generation of the TD STUDIOS / Tyler profile package.  
- All content is based strictly on this account’s conversation history and stored profile data.  
- No credentials or sensitive identifiers have been included.  
- All files are marked `[Visibility: Private]` by default; public usage requires manual review.

### Sources Used

- User-provided profile: role, preferences, and instructions on tone and output formats.  
- Long-term conversation summaries describing domains, tooling, and behavior.  
- Recent analysis/synthesis of user patterns from this account.  

### Items Marked Tentative

- Specific project/brand names that appear only once in history.  
- Notion usage notes (acknowledged as present but not central).  
- Some experimental or one-off ideas that may not represent current focus.

These items remain in the profile as tentative context and should be confirmed or removed in future revisions.

### Next Revision Suggestions

- Add or update domains and tools as they recur in future conversations.  
- Clarify which, if any, portions of the profile can be safely exposed as `[Visibility: Public]`.  
- Extend `10_PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` with additional prompts tailored to new workflows or platforms.
