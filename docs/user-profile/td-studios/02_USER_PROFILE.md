[Visibility: Private]

- System and platform architect for multiple digital products and services.  
- Creative/brand director for web, packaging, and visual concepts.  
- Workflow and automation designer using AI, automation tools, and dashboards.

## 3. PII Handling Policy

[Visibility: Private]

- Treat first name and any brand associations as **Private** by default.  
- Do not repeat or store any credentials, emails, or login details from history.  
- Do not infer or state additional PII (location, contact details, demographic attributes) beyond what is explicitly given.  
- When generating public-facing artifacts, avoid referencing internal system names, private dashboards, or non-public project codenames unless explicitly requested.  
- Never surface or reconstruct secrets, passwords, tokens, or access details.  
- When in doubt about sensitivity, treat data as **Private** and omit or abstract it.

## 4. Working Style

[Visibility: Private]

- Direct and execution-focused: expects every response to move the task forward.  
- Prefers structured outputs: file trees, markdown docs, terminal-ready commands, and usage manuals.  
- Uses iterative refinement heavily (especially for designs and complex builds).  
- Mixes advanced conceptual work (architectures, systems) with occasional need for step-by-step guidance on tooling or CLIs.

## 5. High-Level Objectives

[Visibility: Private]

- Build and refine a high-end ecosystem around TD Studios and associated platforms.  
- Maintain strong control over brand, privacy, and presentation while leveraging AI deeply.  
- Turn internal systems (dashboards, methods, promptbooks) into repeatable, documented assets for reuse and monetization.
