## 1. Web / Development

[Visibility: Private]

Evidence from history indicates advanced comfort with:

- Modern JS web stacks (e.g., Next.js, React, TypeScript).  
- Styling systems such as Tailwind CSS and component libraries (e.g., shadcn/ui).  
- Supabase (Postgres, storage, auth, RLS concepts) and cloud deployment platforms (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).  
- Repo documentation patterns (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, agent docs) and structured environment setups.  

Tyler often asks for:

- Full execution checklists, architecture descriptions, and environment-aware file trees.  
- Step-by-step guidance on certain CLI flows or new tools, while framing solutions in repo/CI terms.

## 2. Automation & Integrations

[Visibility: Private]

- Uses automation/orchestration tools (e.g., Make.com, Zapier, n8n, Telegram bots) in workflows.  
- Designs systems involving webhooks, notifications, scraping scripts, and multi-step flows.  
- Explores higher-autonomy AI/agent setups that interact with external systems.

## 3. AI / LLM Tools

[Visibility: Private]

- Heavy, sustained use of multiple AI tools: ChatGPT, Claude-like code agents, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Cursor, and similar.  
- Regularly designs prompts and agent specs for:  
  - Repo scans and architecture analysis.  
  - Build orchestration and script generation.  
  - Documentation and manual generation.

## 4. Design / Media

[Visibility: Private]

- Uses Adobe Creative Cloud (e.g., Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects) for visual work.  
- Provides detailed, production-aware creative briefs (dimensions, ratios, styles, chromes, strokes, spot gloss, etc.).  
- Repeated work on packaging, logos, and visual systems indicates advanced comfort with brand-level design direction.

## 5. Tentative Notes

[Visibility: Private, Tentative]

- Notion: explicitly mentioned as present but not favored as a primary system; seems secondary.  
- Some tools appear only briefly; treat them as part of the stack, but not necessarily core unless repeated.
